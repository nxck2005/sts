# Revision: Josephus Problem (Survivor in a Circle)

### The Problem
There are `N` people in a circle. In every step, we skip `k-1` people and kill the `k`-th person. This continues until only one person survives.
**Goal:** Find the position (1-based index) of the survivor.

---

### 1. Iterative Solution (Best for Exam)
This is the safest approach. It works for **ANY K**, uses **O(1) Space**, and avoids recursion depth errors.

**Logic:**
* Start with a circle of size 1 (Survivor is at index 0).
* Grow the circle size (`i`) from 2 up to `N`.
* In each step, the survivor's position shifts by `k` relative to the new start.

```java
public static int josephusIterative(int n, int k) {
    int i = 1; 
    int sword = 0; // Base case: In a circle of size 1, survivor is at index 0
    
    // Grow from size 2 to N
    while (i <= n) {
        sword = (sword + k) % i; // Shift by k and wrap around
        i++;
    }
    
    return sword + 1; // Convert 0-based index to 1-based index
