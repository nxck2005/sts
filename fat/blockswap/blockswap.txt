ARRAY ROTATION (BLOCK SWAP / REVERSAL ALGO)

The Core Intuition: To rotate an array to the left by k spots, you are essentially swapping two blocks. Original: [ A ] [ B ] Goal: [ B ] [ A ]

The Math (The "Shoes and Socks" Rule): The logic relies on the property: (AB)^R = B^R A^R. If you reverse the individual parts first, and then reverse the whole thing, you effectively swap the blocks.

The 3 Steps to Remember:

    Reverse Part A (indices 0 to k-1)

    Reverse Part B (indices k to n-1)

    Reverse Whole (indices 0 to n-1)

Complexity: Time: O(N) Space: O(1) (In-place)

Java Logic: k = k % n; // 1. Safety check! reverse(arr, 0, k - 1); // 2. Reverse first part reverse(arr, k, n - 1); // 3. Reverse second part reverse(arr, 0, n - 1); // 4. Reverse whole array
